        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick-spray or
                    use cupcake liners. Grease/line a second pan with 2 liners because this recipe yields about 1 muffins. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Mix all of the topping ingredients together. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitter with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter,
                    granulated sugar, and brown sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. 
                    On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the sour cream and vanilla 
                    extract on medium speed until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, add the dry ingredients and milk into the wet
                    ingredients and beat until no flour pockets remain. Fold in the blueberries.</li>
                <li>Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top. Spoon brown sugar topping
                    on each, gently pressing it down into the surface so it sticks. Bake for 5 minutes at 425 then, keeping the
                    muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for an additional 18-20 minutes
                    or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total time these muffins take in the oven is about 
                    23-25 minutes, give or take. Allow the muffins to cool for 5 minutes in the muffin pan, then transfer to
                    a wire rack to conitnue cooling.</li>
                <li>Muffins stay fresh covered at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
